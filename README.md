# Segmented Google Analyzer
_A WordPress plugin to analyze user engagement by post and author, using Google Analytics._

Segmented Google Analyzer creates a "leaderboard" that displays which posts and authors have performed well. This can help determine what kind of content to publish or what to change in your blogging strategy.

This plugin looks at the first week of a post's life and measures various measures of engagement over that timeframe. This allows one to compare posts from months ago to posts from last week.
